# K-D_Tree
University Assignment for COMP20003

This was a project done in 2020 which used the C language, and helped teach memory allocation and management, algorithms, 
makefiles and binary trees. This assignment was part two to the Melbourne Business Census project, and thus contains 
sample solutions for those assignments. The businesses from the first location have to be inserted into a K-D Tree so that 
they can be found on a 'map' by inputting coordinates. A report was written on the accuracy of the map.
